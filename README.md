## Overview

### The challenge

The goal of this project was to build a **table reservation web application** for the fictional restaurant **Little Lemon**, following modern front-end best practices.

The application had to:

* Preserve a consistent **style guide** across all pages
* Include a **Reserve a Table** button on the main page
* Provide a **reservation screen** with inputs for:

  * Date
  * Time
  * Number of diners
  * Occasion
* Include a **reservation form** for customer details:

  * First name and last name
  * Contact information
  * Required field validation with warnings
  * A button to confirm the reservation
* Display a **successful reservation confirmation message**

This project simulates a real-world booking flow similar to what users would expect on a restaurant website.

## My process

### What I learned

Making this webpage was quite a challenge due to the amount of material and concepts that had to be incorporated. If I had to summarize the main takeaways, they would be:

* Bringing together multiple skills from throughout the course to solve an authentic, real-world problem by building a complete React application.
* Learning to think differently about page structure by using **semantic HTML**, reusable components, and proper state management.
* Working through issues with classmates helped me learn how to ask better, more specific questions to get meaningful feedback.
* This was the first time I took a project all the way from **guidelines → wireframes → prototype → production**.

### Continued development

This project is far from finished. Some ideas for future improvements include:

* Refining and fixing remaining styling issues
* Building a fully functional navigation bar with routing
* Adding more interactivity (API-based availability, real backend integration)
* Improving accessibility and animations
* Deploying the application to a public hosting platform

## Built with

* **Semantic HTML5 markup**
* **CSS custom properties** (design tokens)
* **Flexbox & CSS Grid**
* **React** (hooks such as `useState`, `useReducer`, `useEffect`)
* **Vite** for development and build tooling
